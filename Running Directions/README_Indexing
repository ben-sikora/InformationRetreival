Before Runnning: 
Please run with Python 3.7 or higher. My implementation 
relys on ordered dictionaries which were not supported until then.

The only non-standard library that was used was my Porter Stemmer. 
Please make sure you install nltk before running. 
https://www.nltk.org/install.html

Also make sure that stops.txt is in the source directory

HOW TO RUN:

I used switches to parse my program. Below are their calls 
and how to use them 

-i [input directory] *REQUIRED* 
Please provide the path to the given folder that contains the files to run. 
Do not include the last "/" in the folder. 

-o [output directory]
If you want to specifcy the ouput directory to be set, please add it here. If 
no directory is given, by default it will create and output a "Output" 
folder. 

-memory [memory constraint]
If you want to specificy a memory constraint, add the desired memory after this tag. 
If no tag is given, my program will use unlimted memory

Indexing tags (Use to pick which indexer to use)
-single
-singlePos
-stem
-twoPhrase
-threePhrase

Some example commands: 
python3 build.py -single -i BigSample -memory 1000
python3 build.py -i BigSample -single -o OutputSpecail 
python3 build.py -i BigSample -stem -memory 100000
python3 build.py -twoPhrase -i BigSample
