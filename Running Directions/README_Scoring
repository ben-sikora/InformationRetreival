Before Runnning: 
Please ensure that you have followed the README_Project1 steps and have
run all the posting lists for the indexes you will be using. Easiest to just 
do all of them back to back. 

As with Project 1:
Please run with Python 3.7 or higher. My implementation 
relys on ordered dictionaries which were not supported until then.

HOW TO RUN:

STATIC SEARCHING
I used switches to parse the files

-index [index directory] *REQUIRED* 
Please provide the path to the given folder that contains the indexes to run. 
Do not include the last "/" in the folder. 

-query [query file] *REQUIRED* 
Please input the file that contains all the querys. 
If that file is within a folder please speicify that specific path.

Choosing Indexer (Please select one) *REQUIRED* 
-single 
-stem

Choosing Retreival Method (Please select one) *REQUIRED* 
-cosine
-bm25
-lm

-t [run trec_eval] 
If trec_eval and qrel.txt are on in the same source directory as query.py, you can chose to add the -t tag 
which will run trec_eval for you and print the results. 

-o [output directory] 
If you would like to specifcy the output directory of the results.txt file, please change that here. 

Some example commands: 
python3 query.py -index Output -query querfile.txt -single -bm25 -t 
python3 query.py -index Output -query querfile.txt -lm -stem -o ResultsFolder
python3 query.py -index Output -query querfile.txt -bm25 -stem -o ResultsFile -t


DYNAMIC SEARCHING
I used switches to parse the files

-index [index directory] *REQUIRED* 
Please provide the path to the given folder that contains all the indexes to run. 
Do not include the last "/" in the folder. 

-query [query file] *REQUIRED* 
Please input the file that contains all the querys. 
If that file is within a folder please speicify that specific path.

-phraseThreshold [changing Phrase Threshold]
As stated in my desing document, if you would like to change the phrase threshold so you can see the results.txt
file and verify phrases are working properly, you can do so here. 

-t [run trec_eval] 
If trec_eval and qrel.txt are on in the same source directory as query.py, you can chose to add the -t tag 
which will run trec_eval for you and print the results. 

-o [output directory] 
If you would like to specifcy the output directory of the results.txt file, please change that here. 

Some example commands: 
python3 query_dynamic.py -index Output -query querfile.txt -t 
python3 query_dynamic.py -index Output -query querfile.txt -o ResultsFolder
python3 query_dynamic.py -index Output -query querfile.txt -phraseThreshold -t
