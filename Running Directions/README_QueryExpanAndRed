Before Runnning: 
Please ensure that you have followed the README_Project1 steps and have
run the single index posting list. If you have no specific modifications you
can just run this line. 
python3 build.py -single -i BigSample

As with Project 1:
Please run with Python 3.7 or higher. My implementation 
relys on ordered dictionaries which were not supported until then.

HOW TO RUN:

QUERY EXPANSION, REDUCTION, AND COMBINED
I used switches to parse the files

-index [index directory] *REQUIRED* 
Please provide the path to the given folder that contains the indexes to run. 
Do not include the last "/" in the folder. 

-query [query file] *REQUIRED* 
Please input the file that contains all the querys. 
If that file is within a folder please speicify that specific path.

Choosing Indexer (Please select one) *REQUIRED* 
-single 

Choosing Retreival Method (Please select one) *REQUIRED* 
-bm25
-lm

Choosing Query Modification Method (Please select one) *REQUIRED* 
-queryE
-queryR
-queryRE

Key: 
queryE: Query Expansion
queryR: Query Reduction 
queryRE: Query Reduction and Expansion

Specifying Amount of Terms Per Document For Expansion
If you would like to specify your own term parameter please write the flag and the number you 
would like next to it. By default this value is 5.  
-terms [number]

Specifying Amount of Documents Per Query For Expansion
If you would like to specify your own doc parameter please write the flag and the number you 
would like next to it. By default this value is 5.  
-docs [number]

Specifying Query Threshold For Query Reduction
If you would like to specify your own doc parameter please write the flag and the number you would like next to it. By default this value is 5.  
-threshold [number (0-1)]

-t [run trec_eval] 
If trec_eval and qrel.txt are on in the same source directory as query.py, you can chose to add the -t tag 
which will run trec_eval for you and print the results. 

-o [output directory] 
If you would like to specifcy the output directory of the results.txt file, please change that here. 

Some example commands: 
python3 project3.py -index Output -query queryfile.txt -single -bm25 -t -queryR
python3 project3.py -index Output -query queryfile.txt -single -lm -t -queryRE
python3 project3.py -index Output -query queryfile.txt -single -lm -queryE
python3 project3.py -index Output -query queryfile.txt -single -lm -queryE -terms 5 -docs 3
python3 project3.py -index Output -query queryfile.txt -single -lm -queryR -threshold 0.2
python3 project3.py -index Output -query queryfile.txt -single -lm -queryRE -threshold 0.2 -terms 5 -docs 2
